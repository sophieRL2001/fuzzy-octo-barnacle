        <h2>Understanding Your Plan Adaptations</h2>
        <p>We adjust your plan based on your feedback and progress:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Last Week:</strong> You reported knee discomfort during lunges, so we substituted them with glute bridges this week.</li>
            <li><strong>This Week:</strong> You successfully completed all scheduled workouts, so next week we might slightly increase the duration or introduce a new exercise, keeping your preferences in mind.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal Check-in:</strong> Your primary goal is 'Build a habit'. Your consistency score is improving! Keep it up!</li>
        </ul>
