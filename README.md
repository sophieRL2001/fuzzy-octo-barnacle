# FitSync - INFO 490PI Milestone 2 Prototype

## Overview

This repository contains the low-fidelity HTML and CSS prototype for **FitSync**, a personalized fitness application concept developed for my INFO 490PI course project.

This prototype focuses on demonstrating the core user flow and interface structure for key tasks within the app, aligning with the **design-centric** theme.

## Prototype Files

*   **`index.html`**: Welcome & Setup screen. Simulates user onboarding and preference collection.
*   **`dashboard.html`**: Main dashboard screen. Shows today's plan and links to other sections.
*   **`workout.html`**: Today's Workout screen. Displays workout details and a simple feedback form.
*   **`analysis.html`**: Progress & Analysis screen. Shows conceptual progress tracking and insights (reflection).
*   **`style.css`**: Basic CSS for low-fidelity styling and layout across all pages.

## Key Features Demonstrated (Low-Fidelity)

*   **Onboarding/Setup:** Capturing user preferences and goals (`index.html`).
*   **Dashboard View:** Presenting a daily plan and navigation (`dashboard.html`).
*   **Workout Presentation:** Showing specific workout steps (`workout.html`).
*   **Workout Feedback:** Simulating user input post-workout (`workout.html`).
*   **Progress Reflection:** Conceptualizing how progress and insights might be displayed (`analysis.html`).

This is a **prototype**, not a functional application.
